# Tulpa

Tulpa is a Crush fork made for fun and experimentation towards a more flexible configuration of agents and subagents.

## Built on Crush

Tulpa extends [Charmbracelet Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush)
with multi-agent orchestration and project memory capabilities.

_Tulpa is an independent opensource software project and is not affiliated with Charmbracelet, Inc._

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Tulpa is currently in active development, extending the **_excellent_** foundation provided by [Charmbracelet Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush).

We're building upon Crush's solid architecture to create a more flexible and configurable AI coding assistant without hardcoded prompts and rules.

Currently there is still not much new, so you are better go and use Crush :)

## Vision of upcoming features

- **Flexible Agent Switching**: Seamlessly switch between different AI models and configurations mid-conversation
- **Specialized agents**: Configure different agents for different tasks - coding, reviewing, debugging, documentation
- **Runtime MCP Management**: Dynamically enable/disable Model Context Protocol servers without restarting
- **Advanced Configuration**: Deep customization of AI behavior, context, and capabilities
